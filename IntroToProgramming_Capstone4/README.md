# TaskManager Program for a small company - Using Functions

This is a program code for a task management system that makes use of different functions that do specific things based on the user's choice.

It allows a user to do the following options:
1.       register a new user
2.       add/create a task
3.       view all tasks assigned to all users
4.       view tasks assigned to specific user
5.       View Statistics of the program
6.       exit the program
7.       generate Reports from the user stats and task stats

In addition to the previous project, this makes use of
* dictionaries to manipulate data - in order to make the program more efficient
* functions - to modularise code and to help with debugging
* usernames and passwords - to limit usage of the program's full functionality to the admin user
* specific data statistics - A user can generate stats specific to the user

The code of the program is written in python and it adheres to the PEP8 standard of writing.
