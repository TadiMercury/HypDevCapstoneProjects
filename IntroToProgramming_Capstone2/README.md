# PyGame Project

This python project was to create a simple game with the PyGame library in order to show understanding of
1. Variables
2. Iterations
3. Arithmetic and Logical Operations
4. Selections

In this project I created a game called Comicadres of The force Europa with 
*  1 player object
*   8 enemy objects(castles)
*   8 small prizes(mice)

The player object can move with 4 arrows while the 6 different objects move from right to left.
A counter counts the score up until 2500 where the player will be declared the winner
If the player collides with the castle, the game will end. The player has lost.

Issues I came across that I may need assistance with:
* I placed a backround image to the screen but while I was able to do so successfully, the aspect ratio of the image was unequal to the game width.
* the game objects move slower than usual.
* I tried to place a background color but this too was unseccessful as this resulted in an incorrect output.


The code of the program is written in python and it adheres to the PEP8 standard of writing.
